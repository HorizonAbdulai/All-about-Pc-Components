            <h1>Case Types</h1>
            <p>There are different case sizes made for different builds:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Full Tower:</b> Large, good for custom loops and extra drives.</li>
                <li><b>Mid Tower:</b> Most common, fits standard parts easily.</li>
                <li><b>Mini Tower:</b> Small and compact, great for light builds.</li>
            </ul>

                <h1>The PC Case</h1>
                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <p>The PC case, is what holds all your computer parts together. It keeps everything protected and helps with cable management and airflow. Cases come in many styles, from simple boxes to ones with glass panels and RGB lighting.</p>

                    <p>Inside the case, you’ll mount the motherboard, power supply, and cooling fans. How well your case is built can affect your PC’s temperature and noise levels. A good case makes it easier to build, upgrade, and clean your system later on.</p>

                    <p>Some cases also have sound dampening panels, and space for water cooling setups. If your parts don’t fit or your airflow is blocked, your PC can run hotter or louder than it should — so picking the right case really matters.</p>

                <div class="content-wrapper2">
                    <h2>Why the Case Matters</h2>
                    <p>The case isn’t just for looks. It keeps your parts safe, helps air flow properly, and gives structure to your build. Good airflow means cooler parts, which means longer lifespan for your PC. It’s also what makes your PC easy to manage when you need to clean or upgrade later.</p>

                    <p>So, while it might seem like just a metal box, your case plays a huge role in how your PC runs and feels to use every day.</p>

            <h1>Quick Tips</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure your case fits your motherboard size (ATX, Micro-ATX, etc).</li>
                <li>Check for good airflow and fan support.</li>
                <li>Plan cable management before installing parts.</li>
                <li>Don’t forget dust filters as they make cleaning easier.</li>
