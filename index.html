                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <p>Peripheral devices are external parts that connect to your computer. They’re not part of the system’s core components, but they make it possible to actually use your PC. Things like your keyboard, mouse, monitor, and headphones are all peripherals.</p>

                    <p>Some peripherals connect through USB ports, while others use Bluetooth or wireless receivers. They come in all kinds of styles and features — from mechanical keyboards to curved gaming monitors.</p>

                    <h2>Why Peripherals Matter</h2>
                    <p>Even if your PC is super powerful, it won’t matter if your peripherals are uncomfortable or low quality. A good mouse and keyboard make gaming and work smoother, while a good monitor gives you sharper visuals and better color accuracy.</p>

                    <p>Basically, peripherals are how you interact with your computer — so picking ones that fit your needs makes a big difference in your overall experience.</p>
